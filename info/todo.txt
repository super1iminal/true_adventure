make combat system and ignore the fact that duplicate items might exist. 

OH, a fix for the duplicate items would be to, when an item is looted, if the name already exists in inventory, add something (like a number) to its name

-method to consume a consumable, right now we only have equip
-not sure if looting works yet, but that too
